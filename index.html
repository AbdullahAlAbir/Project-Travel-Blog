    <p>
Travel has always been a passion for me. 
Exploring new destination gave me adrenaline rush from very early stage of my life.
I always wondered If I would ever be able to check mark all the destinations of my bucket list.
However, even if I don't get the chance to explore everything in this world but I would always
try to explore the every possible destination in my country. The creater of this world Allah SWT
has given our earth many mysterious beauty that human race are yet to know and explore. From the sky 
to the deep blue ocean every inch of this world is very mysterious and amazing.Last destination I visited 
was Tanguar Haor.
